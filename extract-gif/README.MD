# Usage

nvm use latest
npm install

Put GIF animated image in ./img folder and change fn var in index.js

Execute: node index.js > targetfile.txt

It'll resize GIF and extract 16x16 RGB pixels for Arduino++.

Replace arrays names to camelCase and place it into INO code.

Remember to change the counter value to match animation frames in INO at nearly EOF.
